# The A's, T's, G's, and C's of William Tange

Actual raw 23andme data, genotyped June 9, 2019 on their v5 chip.

Do with it as you please -- clone, fork, whatever! **Just try to keep PRs to a
minimum!** I'm perfectly fine with what I've got, but don't appreciate nitpicks
or comments on perceived inferiorities regardless! ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜‚

(note: depending on future legality of gene driving heritable human genome, PRs
*may* be appreciated somewhere down the line)
